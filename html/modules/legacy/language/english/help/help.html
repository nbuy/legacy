        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        <p>A kick-start guide to XCL if you are running this admin dashboard for the first time.
        <p>The goal of this kick-start guide is to help new site administrators get orientated to what this
        position does and what responsibilities it entails. It provides the minimum amount of information
        needed to get started and begin with your Web Application Platform and CMS.
        <p>Other detailed instructional materials are available and will be highlighted throughout.</p>

        <h4>Quick Links (Top)</h4>

        <p>From quick links, you can access and search the most relevant features.
        <p>If you have installed Xupdate a top notification will show you the available updates.
        <p>There is also a link to the recommended file manager where you can upload files to the server
        without the need for additional FTP access.

        <h4>Left Panel</h4>

        <p>The menu on the left gives you access to an overview of the structure and the features that you have
            at your disposal to create and manage your web application platform.</p>

        <p>In short, you track notifications and manage the structure of your website from the dashboard.
            Navigate in the easiest way between the core and third-party modules.</p>


        <p>Right Panel (the cube)</p>

        <p>The right panel, also called "the cube", allows you to switch between instances or multi-sites,
            if the service is installed and running on your web platform.
        <p>For example, you can navigate have multi-wordpress switch to an instance to manage pages, posts, etc.
        <p>This service will also have a button to quickly add individual sections, i.e. tasks, contacts.

        <h3>Main container</h3>

        <p>Depending on whether a module, category, or content is selected, different content is loaded in the main container.

        <p>The main container will show a breadcrumb menu to make your navigation easier.

        <h3>X-Update Store</h3>

        <p>If the module is installed, you have free access to the public store of trusted developers.
        <p>You can install add-ons, modules, themes and Preloads (Single File Component).</p>


        <h3>Settings</h3>

        <p>The Settings section is the place where you can customize your website.
        <p>From there you are able to close the site to public but allowing access to specifc groups.
        <p>Set the name, language, default theme, landing module, user account, email, and much more.</p>

            <h3>Blocks management</h3>

            <p>The block management system is built into the kernel and provides five default block positions,
                the order of display, in which module, for which user groups and cache settings.</p>

            <p>The block position is just a legacy code convention to identify areas in the theme layout.</p>

            <p>The block template specifies the shape, and the global theme specifies the areas and appearance.
                However, it can be overridden by a custom template.</p>

            <p>There are two types of blocks : Modules blocks and Custom blocks.</p>

            <h4>Modules blocks</h4>

            <p>Modules have several pre-built blocks that offer specific functionality and favor composition over inheritance.
                These blocks are made available in the block management by enabling modules.</p>

            <h4>Custom blocks</h4>

            <p>A Custom block can be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Smarty variables.
                Thus allowing to create reusable Components to create an effective website layout.<br>
                It can also embed code or integrate with third-party features specific to a site's unique needs.</p>
            <p>The block editor will switch according to the type of content.</p>

        <h3>Comment Management</h3>

        <p>The block management system is built into the kernel.
            It provides a text comment box where users can generate their own comments and leave them on a specific piece of content.</p>
        You can follow the last comments of your articles on your Dashboard. In addition to having a quick view, you can also give Reply to the comment as well as moderate its status as a public, unpublish, spam, and delete it.

        <p>Example: 1024000 bytes = 1,000Kb = 1MB

        <div class="tips">
            Note: Hosting services usually have limits on the amount of data that can be uploaded via PHP
        If you need to upload very large files, you should contact your server's support service and tell them about the size limits they have put in place.
        Alternatively, you can install the module Xelfinder, the web file manager can connect to a cloud service.
        </div>

        <h4>Order</h4>
        <p>In the list component, you can sort by any column. Leave the value by default for the original sort order, or set a custom order with a numeric value.</p>

        <h4>Category store type</h4>
        <p>Choose either the file or the database storage scheme for your image files.</p>

        <div class="error">This parameter cannot be changed later!</div>

        <p>Keep in mind that if you select the database as the storage destination, image files will be stored as BLOB type data which may not be suitable for backup purposes.</p>

        <h3>Word Censor</h3>

        <p>Control Panel > Preferences > Word Censorship</p>

        <p>This section of the Control Panel allows you to enable word censoring.
            It is also where you define the list of censored words.</p>

        <h4>Enable censorship?</h4>
        <p>You may enable or disable word censoring. If you select “Yes”, the system will replace any specified words
            in channel entries, comments, forum posts, etc. according to your preference below.</p>

        <h4>Replacement characters</h4>
        <p>You may optionally specify a word or phrase to be used when replacing censored words.
            For example, if you set “tisk tisk” as your replacement word, and “shucks” is in your censored list,
            then anytime “shucks” is used it will be replaced with “tisk tisk”.
            If you do not set this preference, a pound symbol will be used for each character that is censored,
            so “shucks” would be converted to “######“.</p>

        <h4>Words to censor</h4>

        <p>Specify a list of words to censor. Wildcards are allowed. For example, test* would censor the words “test”,
            “testing”, and “tester”, while *gress would censor the words “progress” and “congress”.</p>

        <p>The profanity filter, sometimes referred to as just "filter" or "censor", is a feature typically used on
            forums and comments that automatically scans users' posts as they are submitted and automatically changes
            or censors particular words.</p>

        <p>Enter the censored words in the textarea using a common delimiter character "|" (pipe) to separate the values.</p>
        <p>Set the characters replacing all the censored words in the input field "censor-replace".</p>
