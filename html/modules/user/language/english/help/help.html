        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>The User module provides the best practices ensuring you have a simple, secure and scalable account authentication system.</p>
        <p>This module allows you to manage users, groups, and set permissions defined in the default security realm.</p>

        <p>The following features are provided:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>User Registration</li>
            <li>User Profile Edit</li>
            <li>User Profile Display</li>
            <li>Blocks about users</li>
            <li>User Management</li>
            <li>others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users are entities that can be authenticated. Each user is assigned a unique identity within the realm.</p>
        <p>To make it easier to administer a large number of users, users can be organized into named groups.</p>
        <p>Users can in turn be assigned membership in other groups.</p>
        <p>Only users logged in as a member of the Webmaster group are allowed with administrative permissions to add, delete, or edit a user or group.</p>
        <p>Users can search for other users according to various criteria</p>
        <p>Users can send private messages to other users or emails through the Private Message module.</p>

    <section id="help-groups">

        <h3>Group Management</h3>

        <p>You can assign users to more than one group and grant access to the content of modules and blocks.</p>
        <p>The installation wizard creates the following required Groups :</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Webmasters (Administrators)
            <li>Registered Users (members)
            <li>Anonymous Users (Guests)
        </ul>

        <div class="error">The required Groups can not be deleted !<br>
            You can create new Groups and modify the permissions for each new Group created.</div>

        <p>The group membership remains independently of the session (the logging session).
            Any notion of inheritance or exclusion must be handled manually by someone with enough privileges to manage group membership.</p>

        <h3>Roles</h3>

        <P>Identity-based groups are additive, which means that identity is the sum (or conjunction) of all the groups to which the user belongs.</p>

        <p>Roles are used to add privileges to specific users, for example : </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Webmaster - can assign users and permissions
            <li>Moderator - can manage only forums
        </ul>

        <div class="confirm">D3 modules, or Trust modules, have functionalities that you can assign to individual users.</div>

        <p>The Permissions section of D3Forum, and other Trust modules, allow you to select the checkboxes that correspond
            to the privileges you can grant to a specific user i.e. View, Post, Edit, etc.</p>


        <div class="tips">Consider your security and access needs, set Groups according to those needs,
        then add users to the Groups based on the permissions that you want to grant.</div>

    <section id="help-users">

        <h3>User Management</h3>

        <p>Access to your website is controlled by a group system by which users are assigned to groups.
            Group permissions allow access to the content of modules and blocks.</p>

        <p>D3 modules, or Trust modules, can extend User Management by providing a role-based system to assign permissions to individual users.</p>

        <div class="confirm">A user's permissions are determined by the sum of all group permissions to which the user belongs.</div>

        <h3>User Account</h3>
        <p>A user account has login information, authentication and profile fields by default.
            Login credentials, typically a username and password, authenticate a user logging into an account.</p>

        <p>User accounts are added through user registration and activation.
            Although webmasters can create accounts in the user management module,
            and also extend the default user profile by adding new fields.</p>

        <h3>Avatars</h3>

        <p>Registered Users can optionally fashion their online personae called avatars.</p>

        <p>This option can be set off from module User Groups » preferences.</p>

        <h3>Types of avatars.</h3>

        <p>One is the system avatar, which administrators prepare by uploading a set of images.</p>
        <p>The other is the custom avatar, for which users upload their favorite image file.</p>

        <p>For security reasons, the only file formats allowed include :<br> .GIF, .JPG and .PNG</p>

    <section id="help-preferences">

        <h3>Preferences</h3>

        <h5>Features in Control Panel</h5>
        <p>This article provides information specific to user management.</p>

        <h4>User module - Preferences</h4>

        <h5>Allow new user registration?</h5>
        <p>Specifies whether anonymous users can register to your site. In case of YES, register.php is available, and <span class='highlight_block_name'>Login Block</span> shows the link to register.php. Even if case of No, you can add a new user in the user management.</p>

        <h5>Minimum length of password required</h5>
        <p>Specifies the minimum length of password. Long password makes a password harder to guess. Of course, the length isn't all factors of strong password. But, you should specify five or longer.</p>

        <h5>Minimum length of username required</h5>
        <p>Specifies the minimum length of username. This option isn't about security. Decide with just your preferences.</p>

        <h5>Allow users to change email address?</h5>
        <p>Specifies whether users can change their email address in user profile editor (edituser.php). In fact, this module doesn't send confirm-mail for users who changes email address.</p>

        <h5>Notify by mail when a new user is registered?</h5>
        <p>In the case where this option is Yes, the group specified by the next option can receive notification mail about new users' registrations.</p>

        <h5>Select a group to which new user notification mail will be sent</h5>
        <p>Specifies the group which get notification mail in the case where the previous option is Yes. Webmaster group is good usually for this option.</p>

        <h5>Select activation type of newly registered users</h5>

        <h6>Require activation by user</h6>
        <p>This is far and away the most popular setting in the world of website systems. A user gets an activation email when they register. They can then become able to login by clicking the activation URL on the mail. This choise is good for most of cases.</p>

        <h6>Activate automatically</h6>
        <p>In simple terms, there is really no activation mechanism, everyone is activated straight away. But, if you use this, you should pay attention to BOT. BOT may register and submit SPAM automatically. Therefore, this choice is good for closed segment.</p>

        <h6>Activation by administrators</h6>
        <p>A user can only be activated by direct approval from the group specified by the next option. This selection may force hard work to activators.</p>

        <h5>Select the level of strictness for username filtering</h5>
        <p>Select amount of freedom for username form following choises.</p>

        <h6>Strict (Only alphabets and numbers)</h6>

            <li>Hyphen (-).</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Alphabets without case sensitive.</li>
            <li>Numbers</li>
            <li>Underscore(_).</li>
            <li>Hyphen(-).</li>
            <li>Less than character(&lt;).</li>
            <li>Greater than character(&gt;).</li>
            <li>Comma(,).</li>
            <li>Period(.).</li>
            <li>Dollar($).</li>
            <li>Percent(%).</li>
            <li>Sharp(#).</li>
            <li>At sign(@).</li>

        <h5>Execution confirmation message</h5>
        <p>This is the message displayed in the account delete dialog. If you don't allow users to delete own account, you don't need to touch this option.</p>

        <h5>Enter names that should not be selected as username</h5>
        <p>This is patterns which your site doesn't permit as username. Separate each with a |. This is case insensitive and regex enabled. In addition, this rule does not apply to the user management in the control panel.</p>
